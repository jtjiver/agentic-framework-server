# ✅ Cleaned File Organization

## Proper File Structure Now in Place

### Security Package (Primary Location)
```
/opt/asw/agentic-framework-security/
└── lib/shared/vault-context-manager.sh    # Enhanced hybrid vault manager
```

### Core Package (Basic 1Password Tools)  
```
/opt/asw/agentic-framework-core/
└── lib/security/
    ├── 1password-helper/set-vault.sh      # Basic vault setting
    ├── 1password-monitoring/              # Session monitoring
    └── secret-scanner/                     # Security scanning
```

### Organized Documentation
```
/opt/asw/docs/
├── HYBRID-VAULT-USAGE.md                  # Usage guide
├── vault-architecture-design.md           # Technical design
└── CLEANED-FILE-ORGANIZATION.md           # This file
```

### Test Scripts (Proper Location)
```
/opt/asw/scripts/tests/
├── test-vault-contexts.sh                 # Vault system tests
├── test-dev-dependencies.sh               # Dev package tests
└── test-framework-integration.sh          # Integration tests
```

### Cleaned Up Root Directory
```
/opt/asw/
├── agentic-framework-core/                 # Core package source
├── agentic-framework-security/             # Security package source  
├── agentic-framework-dev/                  # Dev package source
├── docs/                                   # Documentation
├── scripts/                                # Utility scripts
└── .trash/                                 # Cleaned up files
```

## Usage After Cleanup

### For Scripts in Security Package
```bash
# Source the vault manager (from security package)
source /opt/asw/agentic-framework-security/lib/shared/vault-context-manager.sh

# Use hybrid vault functions
get_secret "API-Key"
show_context  
list_vault_items
```

### For Scripts in Core Package
```bash
# Source basic 1Password helpers (from core package)  
source /opt/asw/agentic-framework-core/lib/security/1password-helper/1password-inject.sh

# Use basic 1Password functions
af-1password inject .env
```

## Architecture Benefits

✅ **Clear separation**: Core vs Security vs Dev packages  
✅ **Proper locations**: Scripts in their package's lib/ directories  
✅ **Clean root**: No scattered test files or duplicates  
✅ **Organized docs**: All documentation in /docs/  
✅ **Layered approach**: Security package builds on core package  

## File Hierarchy Logic

1. **Core Package** - Basic utilities (logging, basic 1Password, scanning)
2. **Security Package** - Advanced security (vault management, token handling)  
3. **Dev Package** - Development tools (containers, project management)
4. **Root /opt/asw/** - Package sources + organized docs/scripts

The enhanced vault context manager belongs in the **security package** because it's advanced vault management functionality that builds on the basic 1Password tools from the core package.
