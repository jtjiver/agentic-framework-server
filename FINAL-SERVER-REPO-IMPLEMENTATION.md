# Final Server Repo Implementation Plan

## 📌 CONTEXT SUMMARY FOR NEW SESSION

### Current Situation
- Location: `/opt/asw/`
- User has been developing the Agentic Framework with 3 separate NPM packages
- Everything is currently mixed together in `/opt/asw/`
- Need to create a clean `agentic-framework-server` repo for server config only

### The Decision Made
Create `agentic-framework-server` repo that contains ONLY:
- Server configuration files
- Documentation
- Utility scripts
- Setup automation

Framework packages (`agentic-framework-core`, `agentic-framework-security`, `agentic-framework-dev`) remain as separate repos that get cloned to `/opt/asw/` but are NOT part of the server repo.

## 🎯 FINAL ARCHITECTURE

```
/opt/asw/                                    # Working directory
├── .git/                                    # agentic-framework-server repo
├── .gitignore                               # Ignores framework packages
├── README.md                                # ✅ IN REPO
├── setup.sh                                 # ✅ IN REPO - Clones frameworks
├── FINAL-FRAMEWORK-GUIDE.md                # ✅ IN REPO
├── docs/                                    # ✅ IN REPO
├── scripts/                                 # ✅ IN REPO
│   └── new-project.sh                      # ✅ IN REPO
├── projects/                                # ✅ IN REPO (just .gitkeep)
│   └── .gitkeep                            # ✅ IN REPO
│
├── agentic-framework-core/                 # ❌ NOT IN REPO (separate git)
├── agentic-framework-security/             # ❌ NOT IN REPO (separate git)
├── agentic-framework-dev/                  # ❌ NOT IN REPO (separate git)
├── agentic-framework-infrastructure/       # ❌ NOT IN REPO (separate git)
├── node_modules/                           # ❌ NOT IN REPO
└── .secrets/                                # ❌ NOT IN REPO
```

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Clean Current /opt/asw
```bash
# Already done - files moved to .trash/ and .archive/
```

### Step 2: Update .gitignore (ALREADY DONE)
The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude:
- All framework packages (`agentic-framework-*/`)
- NPM files (`node_modules/`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`)
- User workspaces (`projects/*` except `.gitkeep`)
- Sensitive files (`.secrets/`, logs, etc.)

### Step 3: Files to KEEP in Server Repo
```bash
# Core files
README.md                          # Updated for server repo purpose
FINAL-FRAMEWORK-GUIDE.md           # Master usage guide
setup.sh                           # Clones framework repos
.gitignore                         # Excludes framework packages

# Directories
docs/                              # All documentation
scripts/                           # Utility scripts
scripts/new-project.sh             # Project creation tool
scripts/tests/                     # Test scripts
projects/.gitkeep                  # Preserve directory structure
```

### Step 4: Files to DELETE from Server Repo
```bash
# Currently tracked but shouldn't be
bin/                               # Old structure
lib/                               # Old structure
index.js                          # Not needed
Any other old files from original setup
```

### Step 5: Initialize Clean Server Repo
```bash
cd /opt/asw

# Remove all tracked files that shouldn't be in server repo
git rm -r bin/ lib/ index.js
git rm any-other-old-files

# Add the files we want to keep
git add README.md FINAL-FRAMEWORK-GUIDE.md setup.sh .gitignore
git add docs/ scripts/ projects/.gitkeep

# Commit the clean structure
git commit -m "Clean server repo structure - config and scripts only"

# Create new GitHub repo
# Push to new repo as agentic-framework-server
```

### Step 6: Create setup.sh (ALREADY CREATED)
The `setup.sh` script:
- Clones framework repos to `/opt/asw/`
- Installs NPM packages globally
- Sets up project directories
- These cloned repos are gitignored

## 🚀 HOW TO COMPLETE THIS

### For New Session:
1. **Check current git status**: `git status` in `/opt/asw/`
2. **Remove old tracked files**: `git rm -r bin/ lib/ index.js` (any old structure)
3. **Add only config files**: `git add README.md setup.sh docs/ scripts/ .gitignore projects/.gitkeep`
4. **Commit clean structure**: `git commit -m "Clean server repo - config only"`
5. **Create GitHub repo**: `agentic-framework-server`
6. **Push to new repo**: Update remote and push

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Server repo is ONLY config** - No framework source code
2. **Framework packages are separate** - Cloned by setup.sh, gitignored
3. **No nested git issues** - Framework repos are completely ignored
4. **Clean updates** - Can update frameworks with git pull independently
5. **Working directory** - Everything still lives in `/opt/asw/`

## 📝 WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

After implementation:
- `agentic-framework-server` repo is tiny (< 1MB)
- Contains only docs, scripts, and config
- Running `./setup.sh` clones all framework packages
- Framework packages have their own `.git` directories
- No git conflicts or nested repo warnings
- User can work in `/opt/asw/` with everything available

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

- The current `/opt/asw/.git/` might be tracking old files - need to clean
- Framework packages should NOT have `.git` deleted - they stay as repos
- The server repo just ignores them completely via `.gitignore`
- This allows framework packages to be updated normally with `git pull`

## 🔄 WORKFLOW AFTER SETUP

```bash
# Update server config
cd /opt/asw && git pull

# Update framework packages
cd /opt/asw/agentic-framework-core && git pull
cd /opt/asw/agentic-framework-security && git pull
cd /opt/asw/agentic-framework-dev && git pull
cd /opt/asw/agentic-framework-infrastructure && git pull

# Or just run setup.sh again
./setup.sh  # Updates everything
```
